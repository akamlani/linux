"WIRELESS FLASH A GUMSTIX IMAGE" INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't have Access to Serial or Ethernet?  No Problem.
Use Wireless Update Step Procedure instead.


# (A): Moving from Release 2.2 (plus patches) to Release 2.x
1.  Enable Wi-Fi with magnet
    <<SSID will still be jim-network for Release 2.2>>

2.  SFTP into device and place update patch and ramfs image on rootfs
    sftp root@172.21.8.<x>
   
    put update_rel_2_x.tgz 
    <<from /svn/Gumstix/update/update_rel_2_x.tgz>>
   
    put update-loader-image /home/root/images
    <<from /svn/Gumstix/binaries/update-loader-image>>
    put initramfs.ramdisk /home/root/images
    <<from /svn/Gumstix/binaries/initramfs.ramdisk>>

    Verify the byte sizes are correct of the images
    (ls -l /home/root/images)

3.  SSH into device and untar the update patch
    ssh root@172.21.8.<x>
    tar -xzvf update_patch_rel_2_x.tgz -C /

4.  Disable Watchdog on target; Kill Rover program on Target
    wd 0
    
5.  Execute Switch Boot Device script wirelessly (ssh) 
    /home/root/scripts/switch-boot-device.sh
   
    choose option #3 : Boot from Update Loader (SD Card)
    WARNING: VERIFY THAT SD CARD IS INSERTED
    This will boot device into update loader SD Card Mode
    The device will then be rebooted automatically
    <<upon reboot will see UPDATE LOADER (INITRAMFS) DISTRIBUTION --- Release v1.y>>
   
    WiFi will be enabled by default in this image, so no need for magnet
    SSID for Wifi will now be svms-network; you will need to change on host PC accordingly
    The Wireless IP Address should be 172.21.8.66 on this image

6.  SFTP the binaries to be flashed to the device (now booting ramfs based image)
   
    <<on host pc>>
    tar -czvf binaries_release_2_z.tgz u-boot.bin uImage rootfs.ubi 
    sftp root@172.21.8.66
    <<Note it is not possible to burn MLO from user space, requires nand ecc hw selection>>
    <<Linux nand omap driver in this kernel release only supports ecc sw selection>>
  
    put binaries_release_2_z.tgz /home/root/images
    cd /home/root/images; tar -xzvf binaries_release_2_z.tgz 
    <<Binaries are expected to be placed in /home/root/images>>
    <<Not required to tar up the binaries, this is just an example>>
    <<Binaries for particular release in svn located in <svn>/Gumstix/binaries>>

    put update-loader-image /home/root/images   
    put initramfs.ramdisk /home/root/images
    <<Only required if would like to burn wireless update capability to nand>>
    <<This will eliminate placing the images on the SD Card Step for reuse>>
    <<Can then boot from separate nand partitions during switch boot selection>>
    
    Verify the byte sizes are correct of the images after extraction
    (ls -l /home/root/images)

7.  Burn Binaries to nand flash
    Execute script: /home/root/scripts/update-loader-burnimages.sh
    Select option 4: burn all binaries
    <<Note this option will also set environment variables accordingly>>
    <<Environment variables will be changed anytime u-boot is altered>
   
    Execute script: /home/root/scripts/update-loader-burnimages.sh
    Select option 5: burn update-loader
    <<Note this is so that we can boot from separate nand partition later - if wanted>>
    <<Warning: can only run this option when booting from sd card>>

8.  Execute Switch Boot Device script wirelessly 
    /home/root/scripts/switch-boot-device.sh
    Select Option 1: Normal Boot
    <<This will reboot the device to the nand partition binaries that were just flashed>>
    <<Wireless is turned off by default in release 2_4 and onwards, so magnet is required>>
    <<Reference HowTo-TipsAndTricks to Keep Wireless On>>

9.  Device has now booted into the image just flashed
    Use Magnet to enable WiFi
    <<Default IP Address is used, 172.21.8.66>>

    Remount the filesystem as rw on target
    (/home/root/scripts/switch-mount.sh rw)
    
10. Modify IP Addresses
    vi /etc/network/interfaces

    Wired Address: change the address (x=rover#)
    After following line: iface eth0 inet static
    Modify Static IP: address 192.168.11.x
    <Or applicable IP address>
    
    Wireless Address: change the address (x=rover#)
    After following line: iface wlan0 inet static
    Modify Static IP: address 172.21.8.x
 
11. Execute /etc/init.d/networking
    <This will restart the networking interaces with the new IP Addresses>
    
    Open a new cmd window on the host pc and verify able to ping new IP addresses
    ping 172.21.8.x

12. Execute setup program from untarred x.tar
    <<x=rover#>>
    ./setup r -s x       
 
13. Kill any programs writing to sd card and flush to sd card (sync)
    e.g. killall Rover; sync

14. Reboot the Board
    Run reboot command at prompt: "reboot"

15. DONE!!!


  
# (B): Moving from Release 2.7 onwards
1.  Assumes update-loader-image, initramfs.ramdisk has now been flashed to nand partition 
    As in (A) - Step 7

2.  Enable Wifi with Magnet
    Can also be enabled by setting environment variable: 
    (a) 'fw_setenv svcenablewlan 1' 
    (b) execute /etc/init.d/resetwlan0 or reboot device

3.  Skip steps 2,3 from (A) 
    <<Assuming update-loader-image, initramfs.ramdisk has been previously burned to Nand>>
    <<No update patch (update_rel_2_x.tgz) step is required>>

4.  Same as step 4 from (A)
    Disable watchdog

5.  Same as Step 5 from (A), But Selection Option 2 
    /home/root/scripts/switch-boot-device.sh
    Select Option 2: Boot update loader (nand)

    This will boot device into update loader nand partition
    Device will then be rebooted automatically
    <<upon reboot will see UPDATE LOADER (INITRAMFS) DISTRIBUTION --- Release v1.y>>

    WiFi will be enabled by default in this image, so no need for magnet
    SSID for Wifi will now be svms-network; change on Host PC accordingly
    The Wireless IP Address should be 172.21.8.66 on this image
    
6.  Same Steps (6-14) from (A), but remove association with ramfs binaries
    <<No need to burn update-loader-image or initramfs.ramdisk to device, unless altered>>
    <<Just perform operation relative to other binaries>>
   
7.  DONE!!!


* Note: #Error on environment variables is not an error (it does not exist)
* Note: x-loader (MLO) cannot be flashed from this method (partition locked - /dev/mtd0)
* Note: Release 2.5 introduced read-only filesystem (so remount as rw rootfs may be required from user space)
