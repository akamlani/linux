"Measure Boot Time" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
Do you need to measure timing based on serial output?
You can get an estimate measure from using timestamps on host development pc

1.  The easiest way to measure boot-time is done on the host pc rather than on target
    This should give an approximate time rather than exact measure
2.  Use the python script grabserial.py
    Can be found in <svn>/Gumstix/scripts
3.  Execute the script at a normal command prompt on host pc (not telnet or serial)
    Note that you cannot use Putty/Minicom/HyperTerm/Teraterm,etc.. at the same time
    This grabs the device serial and uses host timestamps
4.  Execute the following line to give overall boot-time
    ./grabserial.py -v -d "/dev/ttyUSB0" -b 115200 -w 8 -p N -s 1 -e 30 -t

    <note that this assumes a usb-serial device on /dev/ttyUSB0>
    Replace with a different tty device if yours is different
    You should be able to determine this from output of dmesg on host pc once connected
5.  To measure just from the time the kernel starts loading:
    ./grabserial.py -v -d "/dev/ttyUSB0" -b 115200 -w 8 -p N -s 1 -e 30 -t -m "Starting kernel"

    <same pre-requisite notes as above in previous step 4>
6.  Note that this method can also be used for shutdown time
