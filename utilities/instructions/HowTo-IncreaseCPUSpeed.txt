"Increase CPU Frequency" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
1.  The default Max CPU Frequency is set to 500 MHz.
2.  The Gumstix can be set to a maximum CPU Rating of 720 Mhz
    However CPU speeds above 500 MHz are considered overclocking
    At 720 MHz Overlocking issues are still seen at boot-up with SD Card present
    At 600 Mhz no apparent issues are seen on nand or with SD card
    This is based on fixed clocking and ram timing patches up release 2.9
    For stability reasons until proven otherwise, it is currrently kept at 500 MHz
3.  The max CPU Frequency can be changed by u-boot environment variables
    <Reference HowTo-UseUBootEnv>
4.  Change mpurate
    e.g fw_setenv mpurate 600 ---> via linux user space
    e.g setenv mpurate 600; saveenv ---> via u-boot command prompt
5.  At 720 Mhz, it should take about ~8+ sec boot time 
    At 600 Mhz, it should take about ~9+ sec boot time
    At 500 Mhz, it should take about ~10 sec boot time
    Target Compilation is also faster at 600 and 720 MHz
6.  Burning scripts should be changed as well
    As this would be the process of keeping the environment in sync
    As well as being deployed to all Gumstix hardware in nand
    <svn>/Gumstix/scripts/nand-burner.cmd -> regenerate nand-burner.scr 
    <Reference HowTo-UpdateNandBurnerScripts>
    <svn>/Gumstix/src/rootfs-ramfs.tgz -> /home/root/scripts/update-loader-burnimages.sh
    <Reference HowTo-MakeRamfs>
    
    <In both cases change the u-boot environment variables area>
    <This is where setenv or fw_setenv are used>
