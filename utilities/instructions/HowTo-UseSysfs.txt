"Using Sysfs" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
Sysfs is the virtual file system (VFS) of the kernel mirror to user space
It can also be used for configuration via sysctl mechanism

1.  Sysfs should already be mounted upon bootup, so no manual mount is required
    Manual Mount at command line on target can be achieved by: mount -t sysfs none /sys
2.  Sysfs is by default mounted at /sys
    It can also be used to control GPIO configuration and values
    Assuming muxing has already been setup correctly by bootloader and kernel
    Direction of input only pins cannot be changed from user space
3.  Example of Confuring GPIO from userspace at command prompt
    echo <gpio num> > /sys/class/gpio/export ---> set gpio 
    echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio<gpio num>/direction ---> set gpio as an output (in/out)
    echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio<gpio num>/value ---> trigger gpio as high
    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio<gpio num>/value ---> trigger gpio as low
    
    cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio<gpio num>/value
    echo <gpio num> > /sys/class/gpio/unexport

    e.g. <gpio num=114>
