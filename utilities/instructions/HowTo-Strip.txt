"Stripping binaries/libraries" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
It is a good idea to strip unneeded debug information before including binary or library in image
Striping will reduce the size of the library or binary
This assumes you do not need this information for debug


1.  Binaries or libraries can be stripped on target or with cross compiler 
    If using cross compiler, proper dependencies must be setup first:
    <Reference HowTo-CrossCompile, HowTo-SetupHostEnv>
2.  Stripping should be done with the --strip-unneeded option
    This is important for kernel loadable modules (*.ko)
    Else symbols cannot be resolved for the kernel
    And insmod/modprobe utilities will report invalid format when loading
3.  Option (i) On Native Target
    strip --strip-unneeded <filename>
4.  Option (ii) Cross Compiler
    arm-none-linux-gnueabi-strip --strip-unneeded <filename>
5.  The size can be verified with ls -l on comparision of files before and after
