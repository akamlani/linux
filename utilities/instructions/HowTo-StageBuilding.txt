"Stage Building" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
In some cases it may be useful to stage the building environment
This is typical for building modules,binaries,libraries with the rootfs
This serves as an intermediate step between exporting and placing on rootfs

1.  The final staged version will then be copied over to the rootfs when ready
    Useful for involving stripping, modifying, or exporting to a particular structure

    For example:
    (i)  exporting modules from the kernel
    (ii) installing libraries with --prefix set and installing to set DESTDIR

2.  Staging Area is kept on the current build system as:
    <top dir>/build/staging/images -> ${SV_STAGING_PATH}

    <This is just an example based on the setup scripts being used>
