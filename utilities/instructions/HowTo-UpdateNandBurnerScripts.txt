"Updating Nand Burner Scripts" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
1.  Nand Burner scripts are used to burn images from an SD-Card to NAND
    The commands used are though from u-boot, so you must be at u-boot overo prompt
    e.g. overo#
2.  Script: nand-burner.cmd
    Output Binary: nand-burner.scr
3.  .scr files are binary files recognized by u-boot
    Must be manually loaded into memory and then executed
    e.g. fatload mmc 0 $loadaddr nand-burner.scr; source $loadaddr
4.  edit the script
    nand-burner.cmd can be edited just like any other shell script
5.  generate binary (nand-burner.scr)
    mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -a 0 -e 0 -n "nand-burner" -d nand-burner.cmd nand-burner.scr

    <note ths requires u-boot mkimage tool, so cross-compiler environment must be properly setup>
    Sync down the source for u-boot <svn>/Gumstix/src/u-boot-v2011-09.tgz and extract>
    Reference instructions on building u-boot (HowTo-BuildUBoot)
