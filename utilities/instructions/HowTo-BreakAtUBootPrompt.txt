"U-Boot Delay" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
U-Boot Delay is the "countdown" during the bootloader stage

1.  After flashing u-boot binary, the bootdelay will be defaulted to 5 seconds
2.  After provisioning with Platform environment u-boot environment variables
    The bootdelay will be set to 0, in order to minimize boot time
3.  There are two mechanisms to change the bootdelay back to a non-zero value
    This is primarily useful when it is needed to be within u-boot environment
    (i)  flashing via sd card at u-boot prompt instead of wireless 
    (ii) debugging x-loader, u-boot environment, or kernel boot
4.  One option is to change bootdelay with u-boot utilities from linux user-space
    This is when the target is already fully booted and logged in as root
    fw_setenv bootdelay 5
    reboot

    <bootdelay will now be set to 5 seconds as default environment in u-boot>
    <Reference HowTo-UseUBootEnv>
5.  Another option is to place boot.scr script on the SD card and boot
    This boot.scr script should be retrieved from <svn>/Gumstix/scripts/

    It will redefine the bootdelay, conflicting with the global environment
    This will allow u-boot to break at u-boot prompt
