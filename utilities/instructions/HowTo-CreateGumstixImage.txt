"CREATING A GUMSTIX IMAGE" INSTRUCTIONS
====================================================================
Instructions documenting flashing binaries to NAND
From U-boot perspective with Serial Access and SD Card present
This is not the Wireless Update Procedure!!!


1.  Setup Connections 
    Connect Mini-USB connector to target, USB to PC
    Connect Gumstix Accessory Power Adapter to Target

2.  Terminal Console
    Start Terminal Serial Console on PC with normal settings 
    (e.g. minicom, teraterm, hyperterminal) 

3.  Insert "MASTER" FAT partitioned SD Card into Gumstix
    Should contain the following:
    MLO, u-boot.bin, uImage, rootfs.ubi, update-loader-image, initramfs.ramdisk
    nand-burner.scr, boot.scr (boot.scr if bootdelay=0 is set)

4.  Reset Board (if needed)
    Reconnect power to reset board
    OR if already at U-Boot Prompt -> type "reset"

5.  From Serial Connection At U-Boot Prompt 
    <After u-boot loads: Loading u-boot.bin from> 
    Hit a Key Upon Seeing: "Hit any key to stop autoboot: "
    Should then see prompt: "Overo #"

    <If no countdown is shown>
    Change bootdelay from userspace with 'fw_setenv bootdelay 5 before this step'
    Or Use boot.scr on SD card so u-boot prompt will break

6.  Set Environment Variable to burn binaries
    setenv nandburner_option 6
    <Verify with printenv nandburner_option>

7.  Execute the following to burn binaries to NAND:
    mmc rescan 0; fatload mmc 0 $loadaddr nand-burner.scr; source $loadaddr

8.  Check Status
    <If successful, should see following output upon completion:> 
    FLASH PROGRAMMING COMPLETE!!!

9.  Reset Board
    At u-boot prompt -> type "reset"

10. Set Environment Variable to change UBoot Environment Variables
    setenv nandburner_option 7
    <Note after Step 9; all previous environment variables are erased and defaulted>
    <Verify with printenv nandburner_option>

11. Execute Burn Sequence (Same as Step 7)
    mmc rescan 0; fatload mmc 0 $loadaddr nand-burner.scr; source $loadaddr

12. Check Status 
    <If successful, should see following output upon completion:> 
    FLASH PROGRAMMING COMPLETE!!!

13. Remove SD Card
    From this point, do not use this "MASTER" SD Card to Boot
    Replace with blank SD Card if needed

14. Reset Gumstix 
    At u-boot prompt -> type "reset"

15. Login to Rover as root
    vector66 login: root

16. Remount the filesystem as rw 
    (/home/root/scripts/switch-mount.sh rw)
    
17. Modify IP Addresses
    vi /etc/network/interfaces

    Wired Address: change the address (x=rover#)
    After following line: iface eth0 inet static
    Modify Static IP: address 192.168.11.x
    <Or applicable IP address>
    
    Wireless Address: change the address (x=rover#)
    After following line: iface wlan0 inet static
    Modify Static IP: address 172.21.8.x

18. Execute /etc/init.d/networking
    <This will restart the networking interaces with the new IP Addresses>
    
    Open a new cmd window on the host pc and verify able to ping new IP addresses
    ping 172.21.8.x

19. Execute setup program from untarred x.tar
    <<x=rover#>>
    ./setup r -s x       
 
20. Kill any programs writing to sd card and flush to sd card (sync)
    e.g. killall Rover; sync

21. Reboot the Board
    Run reboot command at prompt: "reboot"

22. CONGRATS YOU ARE DONE - YOU ARE A MASTER NAND FLASHER:)


NOTES:
- You can run commands on separate line instead of single line separated by semicolon (;)
- U-boot terminal console does not like backspaces so much, so may need to retype command if backspace used
- Version 2.5 introduced read-only filesystem, so remount as "rw" as required
