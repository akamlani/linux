"SDCard Image on Gumstix" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
For development purposes, you may find it easier to work with an SD Card, rather than NAND
There will be two separate partitions created (boot (FAT32), gumstix (linux))
This will enable booting from the SD Card instead


1.  To partition the SD Card correctly, you can use the script mkcard.sh:
    <svn>/Gumstix/scripts/mkcard.sh

    <Should be executed with root permissions on host development pc>
    sudo ./mkcard.sh <drive>
    e.g. sudo ./mkcard.sh /dev/sdc

    Reinsert the sd card into host pc for autodetection of partitions afterwards
2.  Copy binaries to boot partition:
    <MLO first, if booting MLO from SD Card>
    cp -vrf {MLO,u-boot.bin,uImage} /media/boot/

    <Binaries checked in at <svn>/Gumstix/binaries>
3.  Extract rootfs under gumstix partition
    tar -xzvf rootfs.tgz -C /media/gumstix
    
    <Note this assumes gumstix partition has been mounted on /media/gumstix>
    <rootfs.tgz checked in at <svn>/Gumstix/src>
4.  Sync the data to the device and safely unmount
    sync; umount /media/boot; umount /media/gumstix
 
    <Note this assumes locations of mounting as above>
