"Building U-Boot" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
U-Boot is the second stage bootloader loaded by X-loader and before kernel loads
U-Boot controls how kernel is loaded with appropriate command line configuration


1.  The current source code is based off a GIT tag
    git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git u-boot
    git checkout -f -b v2011.09_local v2011.09
    
    Code has already checked in as <svn>/Gumstix/src/u-boot-v2011-09.tgz
    The code has already been checked in with the proper patches applied

    <note label v2011.12 experiences bad RAM timing issues>
    <note label v2010.09 experiences slow boot, slow nand performance, page alignment issues>
2.  Building (at root of u-boot folder)
    Precondition: (HowTo-SetupHostEnv or HowTo-CrossCompile)
    WARNING: THIS STEP MUST BE DONE BEFOREHAND OR COMPILE WILL FAIL.

    make distclean
    make clean (remove built objects - if needed)
    make omap3_overo_config (note that we are using default configuration)
    make EXTRAVERSION=-platform  (to append platform to image name) 

    <the output binary will be u-boot.bin in the root of u-boot folder>

3.  Patches for u-boot can be found in <svn>/Gumstix/patches/u-boot
