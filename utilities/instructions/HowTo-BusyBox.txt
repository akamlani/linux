"Busybox" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
1.  Busybox is a small static version of the unix utilities seen on the rootfs
    All the utilities are statically linked to /bin/busybox
    This can be verified by performing ls -l of the rootfs
2.  What about other programs?
    These programs were built separately and are not part of the busybox implementation
3.  Configuration Files
    There are the custom files we will use rather than the default configuration
    <svn>/Gumstix/configs/config_busybox --- for main rootfs
    <svn>/Gumstix/configs/config_ramfs_busybox --- for initramfs
4.  Source Code from branch (1_19_stable) 
    git clone git://busybox.net/busybox.git busybox
    git checkout --track -b 1_19_stable remotes/origin/1_19_stable
    
    checked in as <svn>/Gumstix/src/busybox_1_19_stable.tgz
    extract this source code to disk (e.g. <top dir>/build/src/tools)
5.  Copy appropriate config file as in Step 3 to .config in root of busybox src code
    e.g. cp -av <svn>/Gumstix/configs/config_busybox <top dir>/build/src/tools/busybox/.config
6.  Build Process
    Precondition: (HowTo-SetupHostEnv or HowTo-CrossCompile)
    WARNING: THIS STEP MUST BE DONE BEFOREHAND OR COMPILE WILL FAIL.

    make oldconfig  (parses configuration from the .config we copied)
    make menuconfig (if changes are required for configuration)
    make clean      (cleans environment)
    make 
    make CONFIG_PREFIX=${SV_BUILD_PATH}/staging/images/busybox install 

    CONFIG_PREFIX installs to given path
    Note that we are using stage building here <Reference HowTo-StageBuilding>
7.  Final touches on Staging Area
    chmod 4755 ${SV_BUILD_PATH}/staging/images/busybox/bin/busybox
    cp -v ${SV_BUILD_PATH}/src/tools/busybox/busybox.links ${SV_BUILD_PATH}/staging/images/busybox/etc/
    arm-none-linux-gnueabi-strip --strip-unneeded ${SV_BUILD_PATH}/staging/images/busybox/*

8.  Verify there are no shared libraries used (using cross compiler)
    arm-none-linux-gnueabi-readelf -a ${SV_BUILD_PATH}/staging/images/busybox/bin/busybox | grep "Shared library"

9.  Copy from staging area to rootfs
    cp -avrf $SV_BUILD_PATH/staging/images/busybox/* ${SV_BUILD_PATH}/filesys/rootfs/ 
    
    <Note the comments will change based upon performing for rootfs or rootfs-ramfs>>
