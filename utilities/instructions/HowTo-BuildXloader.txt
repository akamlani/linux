"Building X-Loader" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
X-loader is the first stage bootloader executed from the initial ROM loader on target

1.  The output binaries will be MLO and x.load.bin.ift 
    In more current versions of X-loader, MLO and x.load.bin.ift are the same
    In fact MLO is automatically generated at build time
2.  In earlier versions, MLO had to be manually generated by the following steps
    cd x-loader/scripts
    gcc signGP.c -o signGP <this is not with cross compiler>
    cd ../
    ./scripts/signGP x-load.bin
    cp -avrf x.load.bin.ift MLO
3.  The current source code is based off a GIT tag
    git clone git://gitorious.org/x-loader/x-loader.git x-loader
    git checkout -f -b v1.5.1_local v1.5.1
    
    code is already checked in as <svn>/Gumstix/src/x-loader-v1.5.1.tgz
    the code has already been checked in with proper config and patches applied
4.  Building (at root of x-loader)
    Precondition: (HowTo-SetupHostEnv or HowTo-CrossCompile)
    WARNING: THIS STEP MUST BE DONE BEFOREHAND OR COMPILE WILL FAIL.

    make distclean
    make overo_config
    make 
5.  Patches for x-loader can be found in <svn>/Gumstix/patches/x-loader
