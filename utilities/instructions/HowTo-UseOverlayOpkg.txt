"Overlayed Opkg" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
Additional Packages can be installed with Opkg Management
These come in forms of *.ipk files downloaded from Repositories
<<Reference HowTo-CreateOpkg for Repository links>>

1.  Opkg should NOT be executed from the main rootfs default area
    Instead Opkg should be executed from a rooted jail chamber
    Opkg will manage the installed binary packages
2.  As opkg uses different dependencies than our rootfs, only copy necessary depedencies
    Do not let opkg modify the rootfs at will
3.  Overlay the opkg basic system on target:
    sftp root@172.21.8.x (x=Target IP Host) 
    put opkg-basic-install.tgz
    
    Extract the Overlay of Opkg:
    tar -xzvf opkg-basic-installer.tgz 
   
    location:
    <svn>/Gumstix/packages/opkg-basic-installer.tgz
4.  Execute the following command
    chroot /home/root/packages/_install
    This is the root area for opkg where all installation occurs (rooted jailchamber)
5.  Now you should be in a rooted jail cell
    Therefore you will no longer have access to any of the rootfs directly
6.  To see a list of the currently installed packages
    <svn>/Gumstix/packages/opkg_installed.txt
   
    or from opkg:
    execute the command 'opkg list-installed'   
7.  install packages once in rooted jail cell
    opkg install <pkgname>.ipk

    to remove a package:
    opkg remove <pkgname>
    <note pkgname should be that from output of 'opkg list-installed'>

8.  To exit out of rooted jail cell, enter 'exit' at the command prompt
9.  copy over appropriate binary or library from jail chamber to main rootfs 
    e.g. cp -avrf /home/root/packages/_install/usr/bin/sed /usr/bin/


<Note>
Currently installed packages are in /home/root/packages/_install/usr/local/src/installers
