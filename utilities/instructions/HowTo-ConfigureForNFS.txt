"Configure for NFS" INSTRUCTIONS
====================================================================
NFS is the Network File System
This allows the kernel to mount and boot a filesytem stored somewhere else
This is handy when performing development tasks

1.  untar rootfs.tar.gz onto host pc 
    (e.g. tar -xzvf rootfs.tgz -C ${SV_BUILD_PATH}/filesys/rootfs-nfs)
2.  Install package dependencies on host pc (linux) 
    This can be done on Ubuntu by 'sudo apt-get install <package>'

    nfs-kernel-server (e.g. 1:1.2.4-1ubuntu2)
    tftp-hpa
3.  Modify host pc path to nfs rootfs
    edit /etc/exports: <path> <attributes>

    e.g. /etc/exports:
    <top_dir>/build/filesys/rootfs-nfs \
    *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash,no_subtree_check)
4.  Manual restart on nfs-kernel-server on host pc
    /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart
5.  Once already booting on target device (nand or sd-card)
    Execute /home/root/scripts/configure-nfs.sh
    - Change any of the defaulted values when prompted
    - Configure host pc for settings entered (e.g. server ip address, netmask)
    - If keeping default nfs path make softlink on host pc
      from /exports/rootfs-nfs -> <top_dir>/rootfs-nfs
      This should match what was entered in /etc/exports
    
    Requires Ethernet connection from Host PC to target (via expansion board)
    Not able to perform this by wireless - as wireless is not available this early on in boot

    Execute /home/root/scripts/switch-boot-device.sh
    - select option 4 (boot from nfs)   

6.  NFS operation
    Operations should behave as normal but be booting from rootfs on host pc
    Reboot cmd will shutdown rootfs, but not actually reboot the device
    Need to perform manual reset on power for this

7.  Switch back to Booting from Nand
    Change boot device selection on target
    Execute script (/home/root/scripts/switch-boot-dev.sh) and select normal boot (nand)
    just as in Step 7 a manual reset on power is required after reboot cmd

8.  Device should not be booting from Nand as in original state
