"Add Device Nodes" INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
Device Nodes are those files created in /dev in rootfs

1.  Initially device nodes were statically created (/dev/createdevnodes.sh)
    Now Device Nodes are created by mdev at run-time upon boot-up
    The only static device nodes are /dev/console and /dev/null
    Static means they are always there and not created at run-time
2.  To make new static device nodes; use mknod command
    mknod -m <permissions> <device> <type> <major num> <minor num>
    e.g. mknod -m 0662 console c 5 1 -> this is an example of a character device
3.  The other option is to modify /etc/mdev.conf in the root file system
    This will add additional device nodes that are not part of the default list at boot
    You can retrieve the example mdev.conf from busybox examples (src\busybox_1_19_stable.tgz)
